# Autoship 10 Pro: A Professional Software for Hull Design and Surface Modelling
 
If you are looking for a software that can help you design any hull shape from a racing yacht to a super tanker, including the superstructure and appendages, then you should consider Autoship 10 Pro. Autoship 10 Pro is a professional software for hull design and surface modelling that combines the graphical user interface of Windows with the dexterity of NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline) mathematics, the high-end CAD standard for surface modelling.

In this article, we will introduce you to some of the features and benefits of Autoship 10 Pro, and how you can get a license to use it legally and ethically.
 
## Features and Benefits of Autoship 10 Pro
 
Autoship 10 Pro has many features and benefits that make it a powerful and versatile software for hull design and surface modelling. Here are some of them:
 
- **3D Viewing**: You can work either in four views simultaneously (profile, plan, body and rotatable 3-D) or else one of the views singly by merely a click of a button. The four views may be dynamically resized at any time and may be individually zoomed and panned. There are ten levels of zoom/unzoom. Also featured are ten levels of undo/redo to trace and retrace design steps. You can specify multiple light sources and generate realistic, Z-buffered, smooth shaded, full colour renderings with walk through and printer-resolution export[^1^].
- **Object Based Hierarchy**: Autoship 10 Pro's building blocks consist of Points, Curves, Surfaces, Polyobjects and Groups. Groups are collections of objects, including other groups, which may be scaled, rotated, mirrored, offset, and instanced to allow very complex structures to be created from a minimal number of objects. Changes to an object are propagated through the groups that contain it. Autoship 10 Pro's Navigator window allows you to navigate through the model with minimal effort, control the attributes of the model's objects and create and delete objects[^1^].
- **Objects**: Points may be free in space or embedded on a curve or surface. Curves may be free, embedded on another curve or surface or projected onto a surface, and the curves ends may be attached to points. There are several methods available to create a curve, such as specifying endpoints, sketching, as arc or rectangle, by projection onto a surface, by lofting through points and by offset from an existing curve. Autoship 10 Pro also includes a library of NACA foil section curves. Surface edges may be attached to (or matched to) a curve or another surface. Several methods are available to create a surface, including specifying dimensions, rotating a curve about an axis, extruding a curve along a vector, sweeping pattern curves along one or two guide curves, ruling or developing between two curves, skinning through multiple curves and blending between two surfaces. During editing, the dynamic display feature allows you to see both the original and the edited version of curves and surfaces on the screen[^1^].
- **Feature Patches**: A system for introducing local shape control on a surface without dealing with unwanted control points. The feature patch blends at its edges to the shape of the parent surface. When the parent surface shape is changed the patch moves with the change, retaining its own shape[^1^].
- **Edge Mate**: Allows all or part of the edge of one surface to be matched exactly to all or part of another surface's edge[^1^].
- **Autoship Modules**: Autoship 10 Pro comes with several modules that enhance its functionality and allow you to perform various tasks related to hull design and surface modelling. These modules include Auto Yacht (for yacht design), Autohydro (for hydrostatics calculations), Autopower (for powering predictions), Autoplate (for plate development) and more[^1^].
